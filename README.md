# Test Suite Evaluation Assignment â€“ Product Service

## Purpose of the Service

The **Product Service** was developed for the Continuous Build and Delivery module as a practical demonstration of software testing techniques within a Spring Boot application. It is not intended for production use but rather to showcase how various types of tests align with the **Testing Pyramid** and best practices in software development.

The service exposes basic CRUD operations for managing products, providing a suitable base for testing different layers of a typical Spring Boot application.

The goal is to cover both correctness and user-facing behaviour, from isolated logic to complete system flows.
